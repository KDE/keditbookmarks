dirk has noted its buggy as shit even now
if you tab to next field then the current
field isn't saved! (is this still the case?)

multi selection deletion then shift down selects roots
deletion of group shuffles down top elements, should shuffle up bottom
clicking in the increm. search text field selects the root item in the list view
shouldn't be possible to "close" (via left) the root item - very confusing to even me :)
