selecting a closed folder should selected all items inside - i.e, the outer parent
   currently something really strange is happening here
someone multi selected deletes are broken again:
   no longer crashes, but doesn't select current well, maybe laurent just broke it
   TODO note added to program, quite a difficult problem...
a selected folder only takes one click to get a rename???
tbcache: don't create a tbcache file when its gonna be empty in any case!!!
historymgr: get dirtyness working for the kbookmarkmap
proper readonly support - rmb should work but things should be disabled?  no addbookmark, etc.
general xbel bug: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69702

kawil's feature is majorly b0rked, it acts on the wrong element it seems...

possible qt bug:
   multi selection deletion then shift down selects roots
   valgrind doesn't show anything either
   logging all the setSelected calls i can see doesn't help

STUFF FROM BEINERI:

   And the "Cancel" entries in the "Bookmark" menus looks strange too. How about
   a KMail-like progress bar (in a status bar?) with an "X" button to stop them?
   And "Advanced Add Bookmark" doesn't work for "Add Bookmark" in context menu?

---

   Btw, I think when you have no tab and call "Bookmarks Tabs as Folder..."
   it should not only create a folder but bookmark the current page within
   the folder unconditional if it's a tab or not. :-)

DONE TESTING:
------------

   favicon and status check updates:
      removal of items while checks are happening
      program exit with checks and updates are still going on
   random deletion of all items - TODO

THINGS FOR 3.3+
------------------

tools:
   recursive 404 finder
   duplicate finder

basic gui:
   split view stuff - including filtered views
   need to get keyboard shortcut changes working somehow (wheels)
   have to get dynamic filtering (e.g sorting, pruning),

main bookmark config:
   make the keditbookmarks prefs persistant
   and make a simple include selector using
   for example kautoconfig, including a 
   simple dynamic menu config gui

bookmarklets: add some examples!

tips dialog - fixes bugs - shortcuts for keyboard selection are wierd
