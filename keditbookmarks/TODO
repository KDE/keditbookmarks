"MAJOR" THINGS TO DO
--------------------
   
well, too many apparently normal functions also contain
gui stuff. this sucks. its mainly in kio/bookmarks unfortunately,
so, can't change behaviour at the moment, i think.
examples: newFolder in kbookmarkgroup
          importer defaultlocation should *not* have gui stuff

MINOR THINGS
------------

basic plan:       cleanup importing:
                     make all importers do a file selection dlg
                  recursive 404 finder
                  duplicate finder
                  metadata removal at root

general xbel bug: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69702

general konqi:    crashes tabset loading
                  bookmark tabset saving

historymgr:       get dirty working
                - dirty solution to a problem that is mainly konqi's
                - but, still, after konqi is fixed, this should be done

kmail:            evolution like lineedit for searching && maildir bug

keditbookmarks:   make more exporters
                  command line import/export
                  split view stuff - including filtered views
                  a gui dyn bookmarks editor thingy
                  a dialog for bookmark editing

kio/bookmarks:  drag & drop
                editing - name, url, comment, etc...

bookmarklets:   add some examples!

notes:
   http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FunctorObject

need to get keyboard shortcut changes working somehow (wheels)
have to get splitview, dynamic filtering (e.g sorting, pruning),
and duplicate removal and a few other things done for 3.2
