basic plan:
   do any remaining DESIGN comments
   cleanup IS_EF usage
   cleanup selectedBookmarksExpanded as much as possible and rename
   cleanup importing:
      make all importers do a file selection dlg
      make empty constructors for all
      move doImport into the base constructor
   possible use of guistates for action enabling logic?
   recursive 404 finder, recursive sort, duplicate finder
   add some metadata support - comments

switch favicons to use the bookmarkiterator
make an all dirs sort function that uses the bookmarkiterator
add a comment field after looking at galeon for a while
write more in DESIGN - arrangement of classes, pattern usage
rethink the selection paradigm - pruning filters + single base
split off CORECLASS functionality from toplevel.cpp
do the same for listview classes, and abtract further

for me:
   better tabbing stuff 
      - crashes tabset loading & bookmark tabset loading/saving

   (http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45711)

favicons:

system wide bookmark file includes:

NOTES
-----

TODO
features to do for next release
advanced sorting, recursive favicon updates, enhanced columns (comments), other stuff

LATER - attempt to hide away the address strings?

------------ SELECTIONS ------------
DESIGN

the use of Q_ASSERTs everywhere in this file
is kinda ugly, try to figure out a way of removing
them via more checks elsewhere, or possibly by
making "assert helpers" for frequently performed
asserts??? ouch, even more ugly?

LATER

this all needs to be rethought
pruning should be a layer of processing
done after the selectedItems call, the
selected items should be cached based
on use of slotSelectionChanged, 

TODO

the actual selection should return 
all possible items, i.e ->selected()
then pruning should be possible
number of fuinctions
pruning / filters should

on top of this, we can't alpha sort
the root element for some reason
this needs to be fixed!!!

simple motivation for this:
currently you can't even ctrl-v paste 
onto a empty folder item!!!
