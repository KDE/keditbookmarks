general xbel bug: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69702
tbcache: don't create a tbcache file when its gonna be empty in any case!!!
historymgr: get dirtyness working for the kbookmarkmap
proper readonly support - rmb should work but things should be disabled?  no addbookmark, etc.
multi selection deletion then shift down selects roots
clicking in the increm. search text field selects the root item in the list view
tips dialog - fixes bugs - shortcuts for keyboard selection are wierd
selecting a closed folder should selected all items inside - i.e, the outer parent
show a partial highlight of items that are implicitly selected

TODO

bookmarklets: add some examples!
main bookmark config:
   make the keditbookmarks prefs persistant
   and make a simple include selector using
   for example kautoconfig, including a 
   simple dynamic menu config gui

THINGS FOR 3.3+
------------------

tools:
   recursive 404 finder
   duplicate finder

basic gui:
   split view stuff - including filtered views
   need to get keyboard shortcut changes working somehow (wheels)

STUFF:

   Bookmark current tabs as tabset/folder? :-)
   I just wonder how to unset "Show in Toolbar". Shoudln't it be a toggle action?
   And the "Cancel" entries in the "Bookmark" menus looks strange too. How about
   a KMail-like progress bar (in a status bar?) with an "X" button to stop them?
   And "Advanced Add Bookmark" doesn't work for "Add Bookmark" in context menu?

---

   Fine. And any plans to reorder the RMB/"Quick actions" entries to be more
   logical/synchronious to each other and other Konqueror context menus? :-)

    Folder:                              Bookmark:
     "Add Bookmark Here"                  "Delete Bookmark"
     "Delete Folder                       "Copy Link Location"
     "Open Folder in Bookmarks Editor"    "Open Bookmark"
     "Properties"                         "Add Bookmark Here"
     "Open Folder in Tabs"                "Properties"
                                          "Open in New Tab"

   Like moving "Properties" to last entry as in the Konqueror file manager
   context menus? And moving destructive actions down from 1st/2nd place?

   "Add Bookmark Here" when pointing at a bookmark looks strange and if you
   call it you have to close and reopen the menu to see an entry was added?

   And is "Open Bookmark" in context menu necessary? Anyway, my proposal:

    Folder:                              Bookmark:
     "Add Bookmark Here"                  "Open Bookmark"
     "Open Folder in Tabs"                "Open in New Tab"
     "Open Folder in Editor"              "Copy Link Location"
     "---"                                "---"
     "Delete Folder"                      "Delete Bookmark"
     "---"                                "---"
     "---"                                "---"
     "Properties"                         "Properties"

   Btw, if you want to "Delete Folder" it wants to confirm "Delete Bookmark?".

----

   Btw, I think when you have no tab and call "Bookmarks Tabs as Folder..."
   it should not only create a folder but bookmark the current page within
   the folder unconditional if it's a tab or not. :-)

   bookmarkinfo.ui: colons?

   
TESTING::

   favicon and status check updates:
      removal of items while checks are happening
      program exit with checks and updates are still going on
   random deletion of all items
