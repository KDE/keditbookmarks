STUFF:

   Bookmark current tabs as tabset/folder? :-)
   I just wonder how to unset "Show in Toolbar". Shoudln't it be a toggle action?
   And the "Cancel" entries in the "Bookmark" menus looks strange too. How about
   a KMail-like progress bar (in a status bar?) with an "X" button to stop them?
   And "Advanced Add Bookmark" doesn't work for "Add Bookmark" in context menu?

   Fine. And any plans to reorder the RMB/"Quick actions" entries to be more
   logical/synchronious to each other and other Konqueror context menus? :-)

    Folder:                              Bookmark:
     "Add Bookmark Here"                  "Delete Bookmark"
     "Delete Folder                       "Copy Link Location"
     "Open Folder in Bookmarks Editor"    "Open Bookmark"
     "Properties"                         "Add Bookmark Here"
     "Open Folder in Tabs"                "Properties"
                                          "Open in New Tab"

   Like moving "Properties" to last entry as in the Konqueror file manager
   context menus? And moving destructive actions down from 1st/2nd place?

   "Add Bookmark Here" when pointing at a bookmark looks strange and if you
   call it you have to close and reopen the menu to see an entry was added?

   And is "Open Bookmark" in context menu necessary? Anyway, my proposal:

    Folder:                              Bookmark:
     "Add Bookmark Here"                  "Open Bookmark"
     "Open Folder in Tabs"                "Open in New Tab"
     "Open Folder in Editor"              "Copy Link Location"
     "---"                                "---"
     "Delete Folder"                      "Delete Bookmark"
     "---"                                "---"
     "---"                                "---"
     "Properties"                         "Properties"

   Btw, if you want to "Delete Folder" it wants to confirm "Delete Bookmark?".

----

   Btw, I think when you have no tab and call "Bookmarks Tabs as Folder..."
   it should not only create a folder but bookmark the current page within
   the folder unconditional if it's a tab or not. :-)

   bookmarkinfo.ui: colons?
