BUGS FOR 3.2
------------

keditbookmarks:
   metadata removal at root

general xbel bug: 
   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69702

tbcache:
   don't create a tbcache file when its
   gonna be empty in any case!!!

historymgr:       
   get dirtyness working for the kbookmarkmap
   dirty solution to a problem that is mainly konqi's
   but, still, after konqi is fixed, this should be done

proper readonly support -
   rmb should work but things should be disabled? 
   no addbookmark, etc.

THINGS FOR 3.3+
------------------

tools:
   recursive 404 finder
   duplicate finder

cleanup importing:
   make all importers do a file selection dlg
   well, too many apparently normal functions also contain
   gui stuff. this sucks. its mainly in kio/bookmarks unfortunately,
   so, can't change behaviour at the moment, i think.
   examples: 
      newFolder in kbookmarkgroup
      importer defaultlocation should *not* have gui stuff
   this will make:
      command line import/export
   easier

basic gui:
   split view stuff - including filtered views
   need to get keyboard shortcut changes working somehow (wheels)
   have to get dynamic filtering (e.g sorting, pruning),
   bookmark shortcuts
