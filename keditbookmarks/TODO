basic plan:       cleanup importing:
                     make all importers do a file selection dlg
                  recursive 404 finder
                  recursive dirs sort
                  duplicate finder

general xbel bug: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69702

general konqi:    crashes tabset loading
                  bookmark tabset saving

historymgr:       get dirty working
                - dirty solution to a problem that is mainly konqi's
                - but, still, after konqi is fixed, this should be done

kmail:            evolution like lineedit for searching && maildir bug

keditbookmarks:   make more exporters
                  command line import/export
                  split view stuff - including filtered views
                  a gui dyn bookmarks editor thingy
                  a dialog for bookmark editing

kio/bookmarks:  drag & drop
                editing - name, url, comment, etc...

bookmarklets:   add some examples!
