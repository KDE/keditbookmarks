KIconView:
==========

- When you are adding to the selection (eg. by shift + LMB)
  then change the mouse cursor to indicate this. Several drawing programs do
  this by adding a '+' to the normal mouse cursor and it makes them a lot more usable.
  [ I'm not sure this is necessary, and if yes it's a QIconView issue anyway - David ]

libkonq:
========

- delete file : if image, remove from thumbnails dir

- ordering templates: Find a way to use KServiceGroup for this,
  or "borrow" the code...

konqueror framework:
====================

- Remove highlighted text color and text color from kcmkonq, and settings.

- Do we want "[X] Use directory properties" ?

iconview+listviews:
===================

- Hide backup files (files ending in ~ or #) - see #3212

- if we keep "background color for this directory" should we have "text color for
this directory" too... ?

dirtree:
========

- Create dynamic items when browsing non-local URLs (FTP etc.)

kpropsdlg (kfile):
======

- Maybe add GUI (in kpropertiesdialog probably) for user defined actions in .desktop
files (example: see eject action in the CDROM template) ?

- Maybe a checkbox for the appstart-notification thing ?

kdesktop:
=========

- Different icons on different desktops (i.e. different directories, Desktop[1-N],
the Desktop one being the 'sticky' icons)
