/**
 * @brief Base class for version control plugins.
 *
 * Enables the file manager to show the version state
 * of a versioned file. To write a custom plugin, the following
 * steps are required (in the example below it is assumed that a plugin for
 * Subversion will be written):
 *
 * - Create a fileviewsvnplugin.desktop file with the following content:
 *   <code>
 *   [Desktop Entry]
 *   Type=Service
 *   Name=Subversion
 *   X-KDE-ServiceTypes=FileViewVersionControlPlugin
 *   MimeType=text/plain;
 *   X-KDE-Library=fileviewsvnplugin
 *   </code>
 *
 * - Create a class FileViewSvnPlugin derived from KVersionControlPlugin2 and
 *   implement all abstract interfaces (fileviewsvnplugin.h, fileviewsvnplugin.cpp).
 *
 * - Take care that the constructor has the following signature:
 *   <code>
 *   FileViewSvnPlugin(QObject* parent, const QList<QVariant>& args);
 *   </code>
 *
 * - Add the following lines at the top of fileviewsvnplugin.cpp:
 *   <code>
 *   #include <KPluginFactory>
 *   #include <KPluginLoader>
 *   K_PLUGIN_FACTORY(FileViewSvnPluginFactory, registerPlugin<FileViewSvnPlugin>();)
 *   K_EXPORT_PLUGIN(FileViewSvnPluginFactory("fileviewsvnplugin"))
 *   </code>
 *
 * - Add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:
 *   <code>
 *   kde4_add_plugin(fileviewsvnplugin fileviewsvnplugin.cpp)
 *   target_link_libraries(fileviewsvnplugin konq)
 *   install(FILES fileviewsvnplugin.desktop DESTINATION ${SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR})
 *   </code>
 *
 * General implementation notes:
 *
 *  - The implementations of beginRetrieval(), endRetrieval() and versionState()
 *    can contain blocking operations, as Dolphin will execute
 *    those methods in a separate thread. It is assured that
 *    all other methods are invoked in a serialized way, so that it is not necessary for
 *    the plugin to use any mutex.
 *
 * -  Dolphin keeps only one instance of the plugin, which is instantiated shortly after
 *    starting Dolphin. Take care that the constructor does no expensive and time
 *    consuming operations.
 *
 * @since 4.8
