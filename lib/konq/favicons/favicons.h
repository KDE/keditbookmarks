/**
 * KDED Module to handle shortcut icons ("favicons")
 * FavIconsModule implements a KDED Module that handles the association of
 * URLs and hosts with shortcut icons and the icons' downloads in a central
 * place.
 *
 * After a successful download, the DBUS signal iconChanged() is emitted.
 * It has the signature void iconChanged(bool, QString, QString);
 * The first parameter is true if the icon is a "host" icon, that is it is
 * the default icon for all URLs on the given host. In this case, the
 * second parameter is a host name, otherwise the second parameter is the
 * URL which is associated with the icon. The third parameter is the
 * @ref KIconLoader friendly name of the downloaded icon, the same as
 * @ref iconForUrl will from now on return for any matching URL.
