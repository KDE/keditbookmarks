KCM useraccount is a merge of the former kdebase/kcontrol/email 
and kdeutils/kdepasswd/userinfo/. They existed in KDE 3.1, at least.

As a bonus, on top of saving the stuff with KEMailSettings it tries 
also to save the realname to /etc/passwd. This is done via chfn, wrapped 
in ChfnProcess, chfnprocess.h - which is the place to ifdef/modify so 
other systems/ychfn/whatever works.
/etc/passwd is not the primary goal, the focus is on KDE's settings. The KCM 
tries to hide the implementation differences and play nice with the 
user - keep that in mind.

The "face" term is rather scary.. For example I don't think the user immediately 
associate to the login image when a phrase such as this is thrown in the face:
"Your administrator has disallowed changing your face". Keep it in mind..

Some information which was available in userinfo is left out - the home 
folder and shell info. A typical user is not interested in the info nor 
knows what it means. And the advanced users already knows it.

If further information is added, think twice if it should not be 
added in a "Details..." dialog - is it useful for the majority or not? 
The SMTP setting as well as UID should be moved to that dialog too, IMO.
