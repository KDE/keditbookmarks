 * - Editable:     Represents the 'classic' mode, where the current URL
 *                 is editable inside a line editor.
 * - Non editable: The URL is represented by a number of buttons, where
 *                 clicking on a button results in activating the URL
 *                 the button represents. This mode also supports drag

 *
 * The mode can be changed by a toggle button located on the left side of
 * the navigator.
 *
 * The URL navigator also remembers the URL history and allows to go
 * back and forward within this history.
