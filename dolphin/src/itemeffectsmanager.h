/**
 * @brief Abstract class to implement item effects for a Dolphin view.
 *
 * Derived classes must implement the following pure virtual methods:
 * - ItemEffectsManager::setContextPixmap()
 * - ItemEffectsManager::contextPixmap()
 * - ItemEffectsManager::firstContext()
 * - ItemEffectsManager::nextContext()
 * - ItemEffectsManager::contextFileInfo()
 *
 * The item effects manager highlights currently active items and also
 * respects cutted items. A 'context' is defined as abstract data type,
 * which usually is represented by a KFileListViewItem or
 * a KFileIconViewItem.
 *
 * In Qt4 the item effects manager should get integrated as part of Interview
 * and hence no abstract context handling should be necessary anymore. The main
 * purpose of the current interface is to prevent code duplication as there is
 * no common model shared by QListView and QIconView of Qt3.
 *
 * @see DolphinIconsView
 * @see DolphinDetailsView
