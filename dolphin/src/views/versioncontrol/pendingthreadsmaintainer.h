/**
 * TODO: Replace the PendingThreadMaintainer by a kind of
 *       VersionControlThreadFactory that is responsible for creating
 *       and deleting the threads. This would bypass the hack to poll
 *       for pending threads.
 *
 * If the creator of a thread gets deleted, although the thread is still
 * working, usually QThread::wait() is invoked. The drawback of this
 * approach is that the user interface gets blocked for an undefined amount
 * of time. If the thread does not contain references to the creator, the
 * deleting can be forwarded to the PendingThreadsMaintainer. In the following
 * example it is assumed, that m_thread will be 0, if it has been deleted by the
 * creator after receiving the signal QThread::finished():
 *
 * \code
 * ThreadCreator::~ThreadCreator()
 * {
 *     if (m_thread) {
 *         PendingThreadsMaintainer::instance().append(m_thread);
 *         m_thread = 0;
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The thread will get automatically deleted after it (or has already) been finished.
 *
 * Implementation note: Connecting to the signal QThread::finished() is
 * not sufficient, as it is possible that the thread has already emitted
 * the signal, but the signal has not been received yet by the thread creator.
 * Because of this a polling is done each 5 seconds to check, whether the
 * thread has been finished.
