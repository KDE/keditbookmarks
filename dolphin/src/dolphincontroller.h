/**
 * @brief Allows to control Dolphin views and to react on state changes.
 *
 * One instance of a DolphinController can be assigned to a variable number of
 * Dolphin views (DolphinIconsView, DolphinDetailsView) by passing it in
 * the constructor:
 *
 * \code
 * DolphinController* controller = new DolphinController(parent);
 * DolphinDetailsView* detailsView = new DolphinDetailsView(parent, controller);
 * DolphinIconsView* iconsView = new DolphinIconsView(parent, controller);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The Dolphin view assures that the controller gets informed about selection changes,
 * when an item should be triggered and a lot more. The controller emits the corresponding signals
 * so that the receiver may react on those changes.
