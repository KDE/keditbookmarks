 * The following strategy is used when creating previews:
 * - The previews for currently visible items are created before
 *   the previews for invisible items.
 * - If the user changes the visible area by using the scrollbars,
 *   all pending previews get paused. As soon as the user stays
 *   on the same position for a short delay, the previews are
