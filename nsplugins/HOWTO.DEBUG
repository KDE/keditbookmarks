Want to run nspluginviewer in valgrind?  It's not easy.  Here's how:

- Trigger the plugin you want in konqueror without valgrind running.
- ps awwww | grep nspluginviewer
- Record the commandline, then kill -11 the process
- close drkonqi
- in a konsole
	- run valgrind --num-callers=15 --error-limit=no nspluginviewer <commandline that you saved>

- WAIT for four lines to be printed to the screen that start with:
5 ............
6 ............
7 ............
8 ............

- QUICKLY go back to konqi, reload the plugin page.
- You should see the valgrind konsole start to scroll lots of debug output.  If
  it does not, then it probably not picking up the new nspluginviewer.  Try
  again.
- As long as you don't close this konqueror window, you should be able to keep
  rerunning valgrinded nspluginviewer without much trouble.
