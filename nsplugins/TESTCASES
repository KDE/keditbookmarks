When making changes to nsplugin.cpp or related areas, please try to test as
many, if not all of the following plugins before and after the changes.  It
is also useful to test in embedded mode in KHTML, as well as with kfmclient
loading it into a clean konqueror pane.

LiveConnect is not particularily supported, and probably never will be.  Most
unimplemented functions are documented with // FIXME in nsplugin.cpp.
